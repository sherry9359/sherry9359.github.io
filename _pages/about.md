I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Banking & Finance at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg).
My primary research interest lies in FinTech, investment, and intangible assets. Especially the question: how technologies reshape corporate financial activities and investor decision-making and so the financial market efficiency.
